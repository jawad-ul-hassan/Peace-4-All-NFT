            Our NFTs are "green", because they are on the Polygon blockchain.
            The new proof-of-stake consensus algorithm needs less than 0.01% of
            the energy of other conventional proof-of-work blockchains like
            Ethereum or Blockchain, which means very low CO2 emission. See
            <a href="#" class="banner-green-link">here</a> for details. This is

                  There are many reasons why people buy NFTs. Some like to
                  collect them, others use them as an investment like shares at
                  a stock market. However, our NFTs have the potential to make
                  money for the ICRC again and again. With each resale of the
                  artwork, more money will be donated. And you are free to use
                  bought NFTs for any purpose you like. Resell them, use them as

                  NFT stands for “non-fungible token.” This means it is
                  something unique, like a unique trading card or a numbered
                  entrance card. Money, in contrast to this, is fungible,
                  because one $100 dollar note is the same as another $100 note
                  and can be exchanged comparatively to each other; it has no
                  intrinsic value. The Peace 4 All NFTs are unique artwork
                  items. See for more details about NFTs.

                  The Peace 4 All NFTs are saved on the Polygon blockchain. The
                  problem with Ethereum is that the transaction fees can be
                  quite high, often up to $50 just to buy a single NFT. In
                  comparison to this, transaction fees on the Polygon network
                  are only cents. This means that we can donate much more money
                  from each transaction. OpenSea fully supports Polygon. You can
                  buy our NFTs with ETH as usual, and OpenSea automatically
                  transfers it to the Polygon network. The vast majority of
                  modern wallets which support Ethereum also support Polygon, so
                  you will rapidly see your NFT in your wallet as well after
                  buying it and in your OpenSea collection.

                  The metadata and images are saved on the (IPFS). This is a
                  decentralized peer-to-peer network to save data. This means
                  even when OpenSea would power off their servers someday, your
                  NFT and image with metadata are still accessible, because IPFS
                  is a decentralized service, designed to last forever.

                  No. Strictly speaking, you are buying a piece of art that many
